## Machine learning mouse clicker version 0.1  

### How does it work?  

- Record screen captures, mouse movements and mouse clicks using record mode
- Train the model with the recorded data
- Let the model do the work, copying your movement and clicks based on image captures

### What is working?  

Currently only the proof of concept is working. You are able to capture mouse inputs of the click game that is included in this repo. The model will then learn to click in the circles.
