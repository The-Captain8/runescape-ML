## Machine learning mouse clicker version 0.2  

### How does it work?  

- Use record mode to capture the screen and mouse position each time you click
- Train the model with the recorded data
- Let the model do the work, copying where and when to click based on your gameplay

### What is working?  

- The network is fully functional and can be trained to play RuneScape!
- The network can only predict left clicks so any tasks that require right clicks or shift clicks won't work
